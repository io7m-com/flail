## flail

The `flail` package provides a command-line DNS server stress testing tool.
The tool is a paper-thin wrapper around the excellent [DNSJava](https://github.com/dnsjava/dnsjava)
library.

## Features

* Command line tool for executing large numbers of requests against a DNS server.
* ISC license.

## Usage

Place a list of hostnames, one per line, in a file called `names.txt`.

```
$ cat names.txt
debian.org
example.com
freebsd.org
www.debian.org
www.example.com
www.freebsd.org
```

Assuming the DNS server under test is at `dns.example.com` on port `53`:

```
java -jar flail.jar names.txt dns.example.com 53
```

The program will make random requests for `A` records for all the names
in `names.txt` as quickly as possible. The program will produce lines such
as:

```
17:22:52.483 [main] INFO com.io7m.flail.FlailMain -- requests: 280/280/0 (total/successes/failures)
17:22:52.544 [main] INFO com.io7m.flail.FlailMain -- requests: 290/290/0 (total/successes/failures)
17:22:52.604 [main] INFO com.io7m.flail.FlailMain -- requests: 300/300/0 (total/successes/failures)
17:22:52.663 [main] INFO com.io7m.flail.FlailMain -- requests: 310/310/0 (total/successes/failures)
17:22:52.724 [main] INFO com.io7m.flail.FlailMain -- requests: 320/320/0 (total/successes/failures)
17:22:52.784 [main] INFO com.io7m.flail.FlailMain -- requests: 330/330/0 (total/successes/failures)
17:22:52.844 [main] INFO com.io7m.flail.FlailMain -- requests: 340/340/0 (total/successes/failures)
17:22:52.905 [main] INFO com.io7m.flail.FlailMain -- requests: 350/350/0 (total/successes/failures)
```

The program will run indefinitely until it is interrupted.
